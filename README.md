1.1. Enter the available server port number (e.g., 8080) when prompted.

2. Start the client by running the following terminal command: java TCPClient.java

2.1. Enter the server address you specified in step 1.1.

3. Test the functionality of the program.

4. To exit the client, enter "exit" when prompted.

5. To exit the server, press the key combination `Ctrl+C`.
